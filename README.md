# SgtDeleteLongPaths

SgtDeleteLongPaths is an **advanced delete utility** to delete files and folders on Windows. 

This program handles files and folders with **long paths** (paths longer than 260 characters). It allows you to **preview** exactly what will be deleted before you actually delete it. SgtDeleteLongPaths will delete **hidden files** and folders. And it will **keep going** and delete everything it can, even if a few items can't be deleted.

To see the command-line syntax, run StephenGTuggy.DeleteLongPaths with no arguments. (This will not delete anything.)
